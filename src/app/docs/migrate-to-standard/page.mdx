# Standardize v2Table

Currenlty v2Table has two major versions active in production. One that is considered standardized
Standardization ensures consistency across all tables in the system. This involves the following key principles:

1. **Consolidated Property File**

Each table should have a single, well-structured JSON property file that defines all its columns and configurations.
Mandatory Column Properties

2. **Each column must have:**

- `group_name` (for categorization & filtering icons).
- `column_description` (provides context & clarity).
- An associated filter (unless it's an action column).

3. **Validation via Generation Script**

The property file must pass the generation script without errors, ensuring correctness and adherence to the expected schema.

### Standardized vs. Legacy

Currently, v2Table has two active versions in production:

- Standardized Version (New)
- Legacy Version (Old)

Most tables in the v2 Applications module have been standardized. However, the following tables are still in legacy mode:

- [ ] Access Reviews & Certifications
- [ ] Spends Automation
- [ ] Task Dashboard
- [ ] Desktop Agents

## Why Standardization Matters?

The primary advantage of standardization is maintainability. Standardized tables follow a unified structure, making updates and improvements more efficient.

### Feature Differences

- The new v2 improved filters are only available for standardized tables.
- Standardization resolves inconsistencies between the table headers displayed in the UI and those in the exported CSV.
- In the legacy version, some features were built on top of existing bugs. This creates a fragile system where fixing a bug can unintentionally break dependent features. With standardization, bug fixes are applied consistently across all tables
- The new features will only be built on top of the standardized version.

### Inconsistent Table Headers in Exports

A major issue with the legacy version is that UI headers and exported CSV headers are inconsistent.

**Reason**: Two separate configurationsâ€”one in dashboard-api (for v2Table UI) and another in backend-scripts (for export headers). <br/>
**Solution in Progress**: The standardized JSON property file will be the single source of truth for both UI and export configurations, ensuring consistency.

### How to Migrate?

To transform the legacy property file into a structured format, here's a strategy:

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Group All Columns Together**: Collect `group_ui_key`, `columns`, and `filters` from the legacy structure and group them under their respective group_name.

**Identify Keys**: Ensure that group_name is used as the identifier for the grouping and that all relevant columns metadata are collected (is_sortable, sort_key, sortKey, export_key, exportKey, defaultLocked, field_ids).

**Convert to Snake Case**: Convert all the keys like `is_sortable`, `sort_key`, `columnDescription`, `defaultLocked` etc., to snake_case to maintain consistency across the property file.

**Group UI and Components**: Move all editComponent, component, and emptyComponent contents inside the ui object.

**Change**: Convert `header` to `name` and add `group_name` key to the transformed object, if not present. More details [here](/docs/property-file#group_name). Use `sorKey` value for both `export_key` and `primary_key` because in the legacy structure, `sortKey` is used for both sorting and exporting.

### Example Transformation:

Consider the following as a legacy property file with single column.

```javascript
export const default_props = {
  filter: [],
  columns: {
    user: {
      group_name: "user",
      field_ids: ["user_id", "user_name"],
      is_sortable: false,
    },
  },
};

export const group_ui_key = {
  user: {
    is_sortable: true,
    sortKey: "user_name",
    component: {
      type: "group",
      valueKey: "_id",
      defaultWidth: 180,
      style: {
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "space-between",
        textAlign: "left",
        width: "100% !important",
      },
      groupComponents: [
        {
          type: "imageOrNameBadge",
          valueKey: "user_profile",
          nameKey: "user_name",
        },
        {
          valueKey: "user_name",
          style: {
            width: "100%",
          },
          type: "text",
          toolTip: "user_name",
        },
        {
          type: "logo",
          valueKey: "user_account_type",
          style: {
            display: "flex",
            marginRight: "auto",
          },
        },
      ],
    },
    name: "",
    header: "User",
    defaultFlex: 1,
    defaultLocked: true,
    id: 1,
    componentType: "group",
    columnDescription: `User's name, profile image, and account type`,
  },
};

export const filter_props = [
  {
    field_name: "User",
    field_type: "string",
    field_values: [],
    field_id: "user_name",
    filter_type: "search_in_string",
    negative: false,
    is_field_static: false,
    editable: false,
    draggable: false,
    validations: ["isSpecial"],
    is_sortable: true,
    sort_default_value: 1,
    is_filterable: true,
  },
];
```

This will be transformed to:

```json
{
  "columns": {
    "group_name": "User",
    "name": "User",
    "default_locked": true,
    "field_ids": ["user_id", "user_name"],
    "columnDescription": "`User's name, profile image, and account type`",
    "is_sortable": true,
    "sort_key": "user_name",
    "primary_key": "user_name",
    "export_key": "user_name",
    "ui": {
      "component": {
        "type": "group",
        "valueKey": "_id",
        "defaultWidth": 180,
        "style": {
          "display": "flex",
          "justifyContent": "space-between",
          "textAlign": "left",
          "width": "100% !important"
        },
        "groupComponents": [
          {
            "type": "imageOrNameBadge",
            "valueKey": "user_profile",
            "nameKey": "user_name"
          },
          {
            "valueKey": "user_name",
            "style": {
              "width": "100%"
            },
            "type": "text",
            "toolTip": "user_name"
          },
          {
            "type": "logo",
            "valueKey": "user_account_type",
            "style": {
              "display": "flex",
              "marginRight": "auto"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    "filter_by": {
      "field_name": "User",
      "field_type": "string",
      "field_values": [],
      "field_id": "user_name",
      "filter_type": "search_in_string",
      "negative": false,
      "is_field_static": false,
      "editable": false,
      "draggable": false,
      "validations": ["isSpecial"],
      "is_sortable": true,
      "sort_default_value": 1,
      "is_filterable": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Key considerations**

- The `filter_by` object is copied as is from the legacy structure.
- The `ui` object is created to hold all UI-related configurations and `component` is moved inside it.
- The `group_name` "user" from the legacy structure is used as the identifier for the grouping.
- The new `group_name` key is added to the transformed object which should be one of the string from the group_name enum. More details [here](docs/property-file#group_name)
- The `header` key is converted to `name` key which indicates the name of the column.
- The `field_ids` array is retained as is.
- The `columnDescription` key is converted to `column_description`. The `defaultLocked` key is converted to `default_locked`. The `sortKey` key is converted to `sort_key`.
- The `sortKey` is currently used both for sorting and exporting. So just to differentiate the usecase, a new key `export_key` is added to indicate the export key for the column for the which the value is copied from `sortKey` itself.
- The `primary_key` is added to indicate the primary key for the column. The value used for `sortKey` is copied to `primary_key`.
