# Filters

Filters can and should be applied to any column in v2Table, provided they are supported. Before enabling a filter on a column, consult the backend team to verify whether filtering is applicable.

If the `filter_by` object is not set for a column, the property file generator will issue a warning. To suppress this warning for columns that are not filterable,we need to explicitly specify that filtering is disabled.

## Defining Filterable Columns

The default assumption is that every column is filterable.

- If a column supports filtering, specify the applicable `filter_by` object in the property file.
- If a column does not support filtering, set the `is_filterable` key to false for that column.
- If the entire table is unfilterable, set `is_filterable`: false at the table level of the configuration.

At the moment, `is_filterable` field is only used by the script to understand that the column isn't filterable and it won't be added to the generated files.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  In some property files, `is_filterable` has been added inside the `filter_by`
  object. However, this key has no effect in v2Table and can be safely removed.
</Callout>

Currently each `filter_by` object for the column is an array. The original purpose was the need for a single column to have multiple filters as well. But this is deprecated and we are moving towards having a single filters for a single column. This helps connect the filter state individually to a distinct column and serves as a base for column level filter which can be applied form each column header Kebab Menu.

Example: Making Each Column Unfilterable

```json
{
  "columns": {
    "licenses_optimized": {
      "name": "Licenses Run On",
      "group_name": "Optimization",
      "column_description": "Number of user licenses on which the optimization playbook was run",
      "field_ids": ["optimized_licenses_count"],
      "primary_key": "optimized_licenses_count",
      "is_sortable": true,
      "sort_key": "optimized_licenses_count",
      "is_filterable": false,
      "export_key": "optimized_licenses_count",
      "ui": {
        "component": {
          "type": "text",
          "valueKey": "optimized_licenses_count",
          "defaultWidth": 160,
          "style": { "textAlign": "right", "width": "auto !important" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Example of making the entire table unfilterable:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "is_filterable": false
  },
  "columns": {
    //...
  }
}
```

Currently, the `filter_by` object for each column is an array. The original intent was to allow multiple filters per column. However, this approach has been deprecated.

We are now moving towards a single filter per column, which provides a clearer connection between filter state and its respective column and acts as a base when applying filter from column header Kebab Menu.

## Structure

This part of the documentation is still in progress

```typescript
interface IV2Filter {
  field_name: string;
  field_id: string;
  field_type: string;
  filter_type: string;
  field_values?: string[] | number[] | boolean;
  field_order?: string;
  negative?: boolean;
  validations?: string[];
}
```

### `field_id`

This is the actual key which is used by the backend to apply the filter on. It must be one of the values available in the [column's field_ids](/docs/property-file#field_ids).

### `filter_type`

> "boolean"| "elem_match"| "expr"| "date_range" | "range" | "objectId" | "string" | "search_in_string" | "search_in_source";

This is the filterType that backend understands.

### `field_type`

> single_select" | "multi_select" | "dynamic_filter" | "string" | "range" | "date_range"

This is the filter type that frontend understands.

### `field_order`

> "contains" | "n_contains" | "eq" | "gt" | "gte" | "lt" | "lte" | "ne"

Relationship of the value | Operators applied on the value

### `negative`

> Either true or false.

If false, this will appply the opposite condition. The default value that backend understands is `true` for this.

### `field_values`

> string[]| number[] | boolean

The actual value the backend is supposed to apply filter with. Except for `boolean` the accepted data type is always an array for this.
