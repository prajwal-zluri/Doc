### Number Formatting Standards in v2Table

In v2Table, number-related data should follow these formatting standards:

- Amounts with currencies will be truncated after 3 digits (e.g., 1000 â†’ 1k).
- Numbers will be truncated only after 6 digits.
- All amounts will have two decimal points.

Example Formatting:

Amounts with Currencies

```sh
Example:

100 -> $ 100.00
100.99 -> $ 100.99
100.999 -> $200.00
100.994 -> $100.99
1,000 -> $ 1.00 k
1,990 -> $ 1.99 K
1,999 -> $2.00 K
19999.99 -> $2.00K
```

### Numbers (Assuming No Decimals)

```sh
100      -> 100
1000   -> 1,000
123456  ->123,456
1234567   -> 1.23 M
1000000.    -> 1.00 M
1999999 -> 2.00 M
1990000 -> 1.99 M
```

## Using Number Formatting in v2Table

To apply this formatting standard, use the following component structure in the property file:

If the `valueType` isn't explicitly set but data type is a number (as determined by JavaScript's typeof operator) then, it follows the number formatting standard. For amounts, valueType: "amount" must be explicitly specified to apply amount-related formatting.

### Text Component

```json
{
  "ui": {
    "component": {
      "type": "text",
      "valueKey": "app_assigned_license_count", //-> Change this value based on your field_id
      "valueType": "number" // -> (Optional -> available values= "number"| "amount") , But compulsory for amount
    }
  }
}
```

### Cost Component (Not Recommended)

The type: "cost" option also serves the same purpose but is no longer recommended in favor of the text component above.

```json
{
  "ui": {
    "component": {
      "type": "cost",
      "valueKey": "app_total_contract_value" //-> Change this value based on your field_id
    }
  }
}
```
